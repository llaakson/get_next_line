Nematodes, the tiny roundworms that make up the phylum Nematoda, are among the most abundant creatures on earth [1].
Most nematodes are free-living and sustain themselves by consuming bacteria or other microscopic organisms.
Other species are parasites of plants or animals. Plant-parasitic nematodes can devastate a wide range of crop plants, causing billions of dollars in agricultural losses each year [2].
All plant parasitic nematodes are obligate parasites, feeding exclusively on the cytoplasm of living plant cells.
The most economically important groups of nematodes are the sedentary endoparasites, which include the genera Heterodera and Globodera (cyst nematodes) and Meloidogyne (root-knot nematodes).
Both the cyst and root-knot nematodes have complex interactions with their host, but there are characteristic differences in their parasitic cycles (Figure 1).
